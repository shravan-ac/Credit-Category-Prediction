Credit Category Prediction
Built and deployed a Credit Score Prediction app using Random Forest (93.94% accuracy). 
Included data preprocessing, EDA, encoding, scaling, and optimization with RFE and hyperparameter tuning. 
Deployed via Streamlit with Pickle for real-time predictions.

Workflow
1.Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and inconsistent entries using regex and pandas operations.
2.Encoding & Scaling: Applied Label/Ordinal Encoding and MinMaxScaler to standardize data.
3.Feature Selection: Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select top features.
4.Model Comparison: Evaluated multiple ML models â€” Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, SVM, and others.
5.Optimization: Tuned the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV for improved performance.
6.Deployment: Built an interactive Streamlit app with Pickle-saved model and encoders for real-time predictions.
